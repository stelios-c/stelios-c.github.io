## Guitar 
### BMG 
I have participated as a guitarist in british mandolin and guitar orchestras like the Moonlight Mandolins (2008-2020) and London Mandolin Orchestra (2009-2016). 
I was part of the british BMG ensemble that performed in the EuroFestival Zupfmusik in Bruchsal Germany in 2014.
### Scottish Country and Ceilidh
I have been the guitarist and live sound engineer for band Strathcam. I played for the International team in a number of Newcastle Scottish Country Dance Festivals. 
### Solo and accompanist
I arrange a variety of music for guitar, and also play existing solo repertoire for the guitar. I have accompanied various people close to me in vocal and instrumental performances. 
### Score collection
I have a number of guitar scores and methods. I'm interested in older arrangements of greek music, particularly greek tangos, and traditional or popular tunes, classical guitar pieces from the 19th century, and "english guittar" music from the 18th century.
## Recording 
I have used a variety of hardware and software at different times for audio and midi recording, for personal projects and ensembles: Audacity, Garage Band, Ableton Live, Soundcraft and Mackie Mixers, Zoom H5 portable recorder.  
## Music typesetting
I have created typeset versions of my compositions and arrangements using Lilypond and Musescore. I use a YouRock guitar gen 1 for midi input
